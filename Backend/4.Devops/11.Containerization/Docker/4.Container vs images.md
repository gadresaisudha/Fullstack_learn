Hereâ€™s a summary of the key concepts about **Docker containers vs. images**:

1. **Images**:
   - Images are templates for containers. They specify the file system contents, installed applications, environment variables, and the default command to run.
   - You can think of an image as a "recipe" for creating and running applications.

2. **Containers**:
   - Containers are the running instances created from images. They consist of groups of processes that execute the instructions defined by the image.
   - You can have multiple containers running from the same image at the same time.

3. **Relationship**:
   - An image can be used to create many containers. For example, you can see in Docker that multiple containers can share the same image (like the "hello-world" image), but the image itself only appears once under the images tab.

4. **Commands**:
   - `docker image ls`: Lists all the images.
   - `docker ps`: Lists only running containers.
   - `docker ps -a`: Lists all containers, including stopped ones.

In essence, images are the blueprints, and containers are the live running instances based on those blueprints.
