Here's a summarized version of the Docker "Hello World" process:

1. **Running "Hello World"**:
   - You can start by running the command `docker run hello-world`. This pulls the latest "hello-world" image and runs it.

2. **Re-running "Hello World"**:
   - If you run `docker run hello-world` again, Docker doesnâ€™t download the image again since it is already stored locally.

3. **Pulling an Image**:
   - To manually download (or "pull") an image without running it, you use the command `docker pull hello-world`. This confirms that the latest image is downloaded.

4. **Security Note**:
   - By default, Docker runs with root privileges for tasks like binding to privileged ports, mounting file systems, and modifying network settings. Although running Docker without root privileges is possible, it requires additional configuration.

This is a quick overview of using Docker commands to run, pull, and manage Docker images.
