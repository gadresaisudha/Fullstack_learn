Here’s a summary of the **port mapping** concept with Docker containers:

1. **Default Isolation**:
   - By default, Docker containers are isolated from the host network, meaning services running inside the container (like the Nginx web server) are not accessible via the host machine (localhost).

2. **Publishing Ports**:
   - To make the container's service accessible, you need to "publish" the container’s ports to the host machine using the `-p` flag.
   - For example, `docker run -p 80:80 nginx` maps port 80 of the host machine to port 80 on the container.

3. **Port Remapping**:
   - You can map the container's port to a different port on the host machine. For example, if you want the Nginx page to be available on port 5000 of your host machine, you can run `docker run -p 5000:80 nginx`.

4. **Accessing Services**:
   - Once the port is published, visiting `localhost:5000` (if using port 5000) will show the Nginx default page.

5. **Foreground Execution**:
   - The container can be run in the foreground, showing the logs and output, but it can also be detached from the terminal.

In summary, port mapping allows you to access containerized services from the host by exposing and remapping container ports to host ports.
