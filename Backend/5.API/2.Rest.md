REST
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources, which are represented as URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. They use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of requests and often communicate in formats like JSON or XML. REST APIs are widely used due to their simplicity, scalability, and ease of integration with web services and applications.

What is a REST API?
A REST API is an application programming interface (API) that follows the design principles of the REST architectural style. REST is short for representational state transfer, and is a set of rules and guidelines about how you should build a web API.

REST
REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.

When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, despite its name, it’s language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines. 

Something else to keep in mind: Headers and parameters are also important in the HTTP methods of a RESTful API HTTP request, as they contain important identifier information as to the request's metadata, authorization, uniform resource identifier (URI), caching, cookies, and more. There are request headers and response headers, each with their own HTTP connection information and status codes.

In order for an API to be considered RESTful, it has to conform to these criteria:

A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed through HTTP.
Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client information is stored between get requests and each request is separate and unconnected.
Cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions.
A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standard form. This requires that:
resources requested are identifiable and separate from the representations sent to the client.
resources can be manipulated by the client via the representation they receive because the representation contains enough information to do so.
self-descriptive messages returned to the client have enough information to describe how the client should process it.
hypertext/hypermedia is available, meaning that after accessing a resource the client should be able to use hyperlinks to find all other currently available actions they can take.
A layered system that organizes each type of server (those responsible for security, load-balancing, etc.) involved the retrieval of requested information into hierarchies, invisible to the client.
Code-on-demand (optional): the ability to send executable code from the server to the client when requested, extending client functionality. 
Though the REST API has these criteria to conform to, it is still considered easier to use than a prescribed protocol like SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which has specific requirements like XML messaging, and built-in security and transaction compliance that make it slower and heavier. 

In contrast, REST is a set of guidelines that can be implemented as needed, making REST APIs faster and more lightweight, with increased scalablity—perfect for Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile app development.



REST is the most common communication standard  between computers over Internet. What is it? Why  
is it so popular? Let's take a look. API stands  for Application Programming Interface. It is  
What is API
a way for two computers to talk to each other.  The common API standard used by most mobile and  
web applications to talk to the servers is called  REST. It stands for REpresentational State Transfer. 
It is a mouthful. What does that mean? REST is not  a specification. It is a new set of rules that  
has been the common standard for building web API  since the early 2000s. An API that follows the REST API Basics
standard is called a RESTful API. Some real-life  examples are Twilio, Stripe and Google Maps.  
Let's look at the basics of REST. A RESTful API  organizes resources into a set of unique URIs, or  
Uniform Resource Identifiers. The URIs  differentiate different types of resources  
on a server. Here are some examples. The resources  should be grouped by noun and not verb. An API to  
get all products should be slash products and not  slash getAllProducts. A client interacts with a  
resource by making a request to the endpoint for  the resource over HTTP. The request has a very  
specific format, as shown here. The line contains  the URI for the resource we'd like to access.  
The URI is preceded by an HTTP verb which tells  the server what we want to do with the resource.  
A POST request means we want to create a  new resource. A GET means we want to read  
the data about an existing resource. A PUT is  for updating an existing resource. A DELETE is  
for removing an existing resource. You might have  heard the acronym CRUD. This is what it stands for crud.
In the body of these requests, there could be  an optional HTTP request body that contains  
a custom payload of data, usually encoded in  JSON. The server receives a request, processes it,  
and formats the result into a response. The first  line of the response contains the HTTP status code  
to tell the client what happened to the request.  A well-implemented RESTful API returns proper  
HTTP status codes. The 200-level codes mean the  request was successful. The 400-level codes means  
something was wrong with our request. For example  the requests contain incorrect syntax. At the 500- 
level, it means something went wrong at the server  level. For example, the service was unavailable.  
A well-behaved client could choose to retry a  failed request with a 500-level status code. We  
said "could choose to retry" because some actions  are not idempotent, and those require extra care  
when retrying. When an API is idempotent, making  multiple identical requests has the same effect  
as making a single request. This is usually not the  case for a POST request to create a new resource.  
The response body is optional and could contain  the data payload and is usually formatted in JSON.  
There's a critical attribute of  REST that is worth discussing more.  
A REST implementation should be stateless. It  means the two parties don't need to store any  
information about each other, and every request  and response (cycle) is independent from all others.  
This leads to web applications that are easy to  scale and well behaved. There are two final points  
to discuss to round out a well-behaved RESTful API.  If an API endpoint returns a huge amount of data,  
use pagination. A common pagination scheme  uses "limit" and "offset" as parameters. Here is  
an example. If they are not specified, the server  should assume sensible default values. Lastly,  
versioning of an API is very important. Versioning  allows an implementation to provide backward  
compatibility, so that if we introduce breaking  changes from one version to another, consumers  
can get enough time to move to the next version.  There are many ways to version an API. The most  
straightforward is to prefix the version before  the resource on the URI. For instance, like this.
RESTful API is simple and effective when  applied sensibly. It may not be the best  
choice for all companies, but it is simple and  good enough, and that's why it is so widely used.  
There are other popular API options like GraphQL  and gRPC.


REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style, not a strict protocol or standard. It provides guidelines for building APIs that are scalable, flexible, and easy to interact with, making it a popular choice for web services, especially in mobile and IoT (Internet of Things) development.

When a client sends a request to a RESTful API, it receives a representation of the state of a resource (data) from the server. This representation can be delivered in different formats, such as JSON (the most common because it's both human- and machine-readable), XML, HTML, plain text, or even other formats like Python or PHP. JSON’s flexibility and simplicity make it widely used across different systems and programming languages.

Key Concepts in REST:
Client-Server Architecture: REST separates the client (which requests information) and the server (which provides the data). Clients request resources, and servers respond with the requested data, usually via HTTP.

Statelessness: Each request sent to the server is independent and unrelated to previous ones. The server does not store any client information between requests, which improves scalability because it doesn't need to keep track of sessions. Each request contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and process it.

Cacheable Responses: Responses from the server can be marked as cacheable, meaning clients can store them for a period of time and reuse them without making repeated requests to the server. This reduces load and speeds up interactions.

Uniform Interface: REST relies on a standard way of interacting with resources, simplifying development and making APIs easier to use. The key parts of the uniform interface are:

Resource Identification: Resources (such as a user, blog post, etc.) are identified via unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), like http://example.com/users/123.
Resource Manipulation: Once a client retrieves a resource (e.g., JSON data), it can modify or manipulate it using the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Self-Descriptive Messages: Each response message contains enough information for the client to understand how to process it.
Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): The client should be able to discover all possible actions and navigation through hyperlinks provided within the resource representation. For example, after fetching a user’s profile, the response might include links to update or delete that profile.
Layered System: REST architecture can be organized into layers, such as security, load balancing, or caching, which are invisible to the client. Each layer has a specific role in managing the request, which helps to increase flexibility and scalability.

Code-on-Demand (optional): Although not commonly used, REST allows servers to send executable code (e.g., JavaScript) to clients, expanding their functionality dynamically.
