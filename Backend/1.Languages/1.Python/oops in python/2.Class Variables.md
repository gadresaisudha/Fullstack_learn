# **Class Variables in Python**
## **Understanding Variables in a Class**
In object-oriented programming, variables in a class can be classified into:
1. **Instance Variables** – Unique to each instance (object) of a class.
2. **Class Variables** – Shared among all instances of a class.

---

## **1. Instance Variables vs. Class Variables**
### **Instance Variables**
- Defined within the `__init__()` method.
- They belong to each specific instance of the class.
- Each object gets its own copy of instance variables.

#### **Example of Instance Variables**
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, email, pay):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.pay = pay  # Instance variable
```
Here, `name`, `email`, and `pay` are **instance variables**, and each `Employee` object has its own separate values.

---
### **Class Variables**
- Defined outside the `__init__()` method.
- Shared among all instances of the class.
- Changing a class variable affects all instances unless overridden by an instance.

#### **Example of a Class Variable**
```python
class Employee:
    raise_amount = 1.04  # Class variable shared by all instances

    def __init__(self, name, email, pay):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.pay = pay

    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * Employee.raise_amount)  # Using class variable
```
Here, `raise_amount` is a **class variable**, meaning **all employees** share the same raise percentage.

---
## **2. Accessing Class Variables**
Class variables can be accessed:
- **Using the class name:**
  ```python
  print(Employee.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.04
  ```
- **Using an instance of the class:**
  ```python
  emp1 = Employee("John Doe", "john@example.com", 50000)
  print(emp1.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.04
  ```
  - The instance `emp1` does **not** have its own `raise_amount`. It inherits it from the class.

---
## **3. Modifying Class Variables**
### **3.1 Changing a Class Variable Using the Class Name (Affects All Instances)**
```python
Employee.raise_amount = 1.05  # Changing the class variable

emp1 = Employee("John Doe", "john@example.com", 50000)
emp2 = Employee("Jane Smith", "jane@example.com", 60000)

print(emp1.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.05
print(emp2.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.05
```
Since `raise_amount` is changed at the **class level**, all instances reflect the change.

---
### **3.2 Changing a Class Variable Using an Instance (Creates an Instance Variable)**
```python
emp1.raise_amount = 1.06  # Creating an instance variable
```
- This **does not** change the class variable.
- Instead, it creates a **new instance variable** named `raise_amount` that belongs only to `emp1`.

#### **Verifying the Change**
```python
print(emp1.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.06
print(emp2.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.05 (unchanged)
print(Employee.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.05 (unchanged)
```
- `emp1` now has its own `raise_amount` (1.06).
- `emp2` still uses the class variable (1.05).

---
## **4. Checking Namespace**
Python stores instance and class attributes separately.

### **Checking Instance Attributes**
```python
emp1 = Employee("John Doe", "john@example.com", 50000)
print(emp1.__dict__)  # Shows only instance attributes
```
**Output:**
```python
{'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com', 'pay': 50000}
```
Since `raise_amount` is a class variable, it is **not** in `emp1.__dict__`.

### **Checking Class Attributes**
```python
print(Employee.__dict__)  # Shows all class attributes
```
**Output (partial):**
```python
{'raise_amount': 1.04, '__init__': <function Employee.__init__ at 0x...>}
```
- `raise_amount` appears here, meaning it is stored at the **class level**.

---
## **5. Example: Class vs. Instance Variable Behavior**
```python
class Employee:
    raise_amount = 1.04  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, name, email, pay):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.pay = pay

    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)  # Uses instance or class variable
```
- If `self.raise_amount` exists (instance variable), it is used.
- Otherwise, `Employee.raise_amount` (class variable) is used.

#### **Testing the Behavior**
```python
emp1 = Employee("John Doe", "john@example.com", 50000)
emp2 = Employee("Jane Smith", "jane@example.com", 60000)

Employee.raise_amount = 1.05  # Change class variable
print(emp1.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.05
print(emp2.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.05

emp1.raise_amount = 1.06  # Create instance variable
print(emp1.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.06 (instance variable)
print(emp2.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.05 (still using class variable)
```

---
## **6. Best Practices**
✅ **Use class variables for values shared across all instances.**
✅ **Access class variables using `self` inside instance methods to allow flexibility.**
✅ **Be cautious when modifying class variables using an instance—it creates a new instance variable instead.**
✅ **Use `Employee.raise_amount` for class-wide changes, and `self.raise_amount` for instance-specific changes.**

---
## **Summary**
| Feature            | Instance Variable | Class Variable |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Definition**    | Inside `__init__` | Outside `__init__` |
| **Scope**        | Specific to an instance | Shared across all instances |
| **Stored In**    | `self.__dict__` | `Class.__dict__` |
| **Modification** | Affects only one instance | Affects all instances (unless overridden) |
| **Access**      | `self.variable_name` | `Class.variable_name` |

### **Adding `num_of_employees` to Track Object Count**
Let's modify the `Employee` class by adding a class variable `num_of_employees` and incrementing it each time an instance is created.

#### **Example with `num_of_employees`**
```python
class Employee:
    num_of_employees = 0  # Class variable to track number of instances
    raise_amount = 1.04  # Another class variable

    def __init__(self, name, email, pay):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.pay = pay

        Employee.num_of_employees += 1  # Increment class variable

# Creating employee instances
emp1 = Employee("John Doe", "john@example.com", 50000)
emp2 = Employee("Jane Smith", "jane@example.com", 60000)

print(Employee.num_of_employees)  # Output: 2
```
### **How It Works:**
- `num_of_employees = 0` is a **class variable**.
- Each time an instance (`emp1`, `emp2`, etc.) is created, `Employee.num_of_employees` **increments by 1**.
- The value is **shared among all instances** because it's a class-level attribute.

---

### **Accessing `num_of_employees`**
Since `num_of_employees` is a class variable, it can be accessed using:
1. The class name:
   ```python
   print(Employee.num_of_employees)  # Output: 2
   ```
2. An instance (not recommended, but possible):
   ```python
   print(emp1.num_of_employees)  # Output: 2
   ```

---

### **What If We Modify `num_of_employees` Using an Instance?**
If you modify it using an instance, it creates a **new instance variable** instead of changing the class variable.

```python
emp1.num_of_employees = 10  # Creates an instance variable
print(emp1.num_of_employees)  # Output: 10 (instance-specific)
print(Employee.num_of_employees)  # Output: 2 (unchanged)
```
- `emp1` now has its own separate `num_of_employees`, but the **class variable remains the same**.

---

### **Ensuring Proper Incrementing**
Instead of using `Employee.num_of_employees += 1`, a better approach is to use `cls` inside a class method.

```python
class Employee:
    num_of_employees = 0

    def __init__(self, name, email, pay):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.pay = pay

        type(self).num_of_employees += 1  # Using `type(self)`

# Creating instances
emp1 = Employee("John Doe", "john@example.com", 50000)
emp2 = Employee("Jane Smith", "jane@example.com", 60000)

print(Employee.num_of_employees)  # Output: 2
```
Using `type(self).num_of_employees` makes the code more **dynamic**, allowing subclasses to maintain their own counters.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ **Class variables** like `num_of_employees` are shared across all instances.
✅ **Incrementing inside `__init__` ensures each new object updates the count.**
✅ **Modifying a class variable through an instance creates an instance variable instead.**
✅ **Using `type(self).num_of_employees` makes it subclass-friendly.**
