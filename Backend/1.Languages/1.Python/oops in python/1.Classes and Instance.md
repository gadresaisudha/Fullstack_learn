# **Introduction to Python Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

In this tutorial, we will explore how to create and use **classes** in Python, as well as how **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts are applied in Python.

Since working with classes involves multiple topics, we will divide the discussion into several sections. In this first part, we will cover:

- What are **classes** and **instances**?
- How to **create** and **instantiate** classes?
- What are **attributes** and **methods**?
- How to use the `__init__` method to initialize objects?

## **Why Use Classes?**
Before diving into coding, it's essential to understand why classes are useful.

In modern programming languages, including Python, **classes** allow us to:
1. **Logically group data and functions together** – this makes the code more reusable and easier to maintain.
2. **Model real-world entities** – classes help structure data and behavior in a way that resembles real-world objects.
3. **Reuse code efficiently** – instead of writing repetitive logic, we can use classes as templates (blueprints) for creating multiple objects.
4. **Encapsulate functionality** – classes keep related data and behaviors together, making the code more modular and organized.

## **Basic Terminology: Attributes and Methods**
In the context of OOP:
- **Attributes**: These are the **data** (variables) associated with a class.
- **Methods**: These are the **functions** defined inside a class, which operate on the attributes.

## **Creating a Simple Class in Python**
We start by defining a basic class. In Python, a class is created using the `class` keyword:

```python
class Employee:
    pass  # Placeholder for now
```

- The keyword `class` defines a new class named `Employee`.
- The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder since an empty class would cause an error.

Now, let's create instances (objects) of this class.

```python
emp1 = Employee()
emp2 = Employee()

print(emp1)
print(emp2)
```

### **Output:**
```
<__main__.Employee object at 0x7f8b9c2b7d60>
<__main__.Employee object at 0x7f8b9c2b7e20>
```

- `emp1` and `emp2` are **instances** of the `Employee` class.
- Each instance is stored at a unique memory address, meaning they are different objects.

## **Class vs. Instance**
- The **class** itself is just a blueprint.
- Each **instance** (object) of the class has its own unique identity and stores its own data.

### **Adding Instance Variables**
Now, let's manually add attributes to the instances.

```python
emp1.first = "Corey"
emp1.last = "Schafer"
emp1.email = "corey.schafer@company.com"
emp1.pay = 50000

emp2.first = "Test"
emp2.last = "User"
emp2.email = "test.user@company.com"
emp2.pay = 60000
```

### **Accessing Instance Variables**
We can access attributes using dot notation:

```python
print(emp1.email)  # corey.schafer@company.com
print(emp2.email)  # test.user@company.com
```

However, this approach is inefficient:
- It requires **manual attribute assignment** for every instance.
- It’s **prone to errors**, as seen when forgetting to update `emp2` properly.

## **Using the `__init__` Method**
To automate instance attribute creation, we use the **`__init__` method**, which is Python's **constructor**.

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first  # Instance variable for first name
        self.last = last    # Instance variable for last name
        self.pay = pay      # Instance variable for salary
        self.email = f"{first.lower()}.{last.lower()}@company.com"  # Auto-generate email

# Creating employee instances with required data
emp1 = Employee("Corey", "Schafer", 50000)
emp2 = Employee("Test", "User", 60000)

print(emp1.email)  # Output: corey.schafer@company.com
print(emp2.email)  # Output: test.user@company.com
```

### **Explanation of `__init__`:**
- `__init__` is automatically called when a new instance is created.
- `self` refers to the **instance** created.
- `first`, `last`, and `pay` are **parameters** passed when creating an object.
- `self.first = first` assigns the value of `first` to an **instance variable**.
- The **email attribute** is auto-generated using `first.last@company.com`.

## **Adding a Method to a Class**
A **method** is a function defined inside a class that performs actions related to that class.

Let's add a method that returns the full name of an employee:

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = f"{first.lower()}.{last.lower()}@company.com"

    def fullname(self):
        return f"{self.first} {self.last}"

# Creating employee instances
emp1 = Employee("Corey", "Schafer", 50000)
emp2 = Employee("Test", "User", 60000)

# Calling the method
print(emp1.fullname())  # Output: Corey Schafer
print(emp2.fullname())  # Output: Test User
```

### **Key Takeaways:**
- `fullname(self)`: This method returns the full name of an employee.
- `self` ensures the method operates on the specific instance calling it.

## **Calling Methods Using Class Name**
Another way to call the method is:

```python
print(Employee.fullname(emp1))  # Equivalent to emp1.fullname()
```

This works because:
- `emp1.fullname()` automatically passes `emp1` as `self`.
- `Employee.fullname(emp1)` manually passes `emp1`.

- What **classes** and **instances** are.
- How to **create classes** and **instantiate objects**.
- How to define **instance attributes** using `__init__`.
