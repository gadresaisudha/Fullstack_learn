Here are the notes summarizing Flask's async and await support:
________________________________________
Flask Async and Await Support
1. Enabling Async in Flask
â€¢	Flask supports async and await for routes, error handlers, before/after request functions, and teardown functions if installed with the async extra:
â€¢	pip install flask[async]
â€¢	Example of an async route:
â€¢	@app.route("/get-data")
â€¢	async def get_data():
â€¢	    data = await async_db_query(...)
â€¢	    return jsonify(data)
2. Async in Class-Based Views
â€¢	dispatch_request() in views that inherit from flask.views.View can be async.
â€¢	HTTP method handlers in flask.views.MethodView can also be async.
3. Using Async with Greenlet
â€¢	When using gevent or eventlet, greenlet>=1.0 is required.
â€¢	On PyPy, PyPy>=7.3.7 is required.
4. Performance Considerations
â€¢	Flask runs a single worker per request-response cycle, even with async views.
â€¢	Async functions require an event loop, which Flask starts in a thread for async views.
â€¢	Async is beneficial for IO-bound tasks (e.g., multiple database queries, external API calls).
â€¢	Async does not improve CPU-bound tasks.
â€¢	Flaskâ€™s async support allows integration with existing async-based libraries.
5. Background Tasks
â€¢	Async functions run in an event loop until completion, at which point the event loop stops.
â€¢	Any additional async tasks spawned will be canceled if not completed.
â€¢	asyncio.create_task() does not work for background tasks in Flask.
â€¢	Use a task queue instead for background processing.
â€¢	To spawn async tasks, run Flask with an ASGI server and use the asgiref.WsgiToAsgi adapter.
6. When to Use Quart Instead
â€¢	Quart is an ASGI-based alternative to Flask for fully async applications.
â€¢	Flaskâ€™s async support is less performant than async-first frameworks like Quart.
â€¢	Quart handles multiple concurrent requests and long-running requests without multiple worker processes or threads.
â€¢	Flask can still be used with Gevent or Eventlet to get async benefits.
7. Flask Extensions and Async Support
â€¢	Many Flask extensions do not support async views by default.
â€¢	Decorators from older extensions might not await async views, causing issues.
â€¢	Flask provides flask.Flask.ensure_sync() to help extensions work with async functions.
â€¢	Example of an extension decorator supporting async views:
â€¢	def extension(func):
â€¢	    @wraps(func)
â€¢	    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
â€¢	        ...  # Extension logic
â€¢	        return current_app.ensure_sync(func)(*args, **kwargs)
â€¢	    return wrapper
â€¢	Check the changelog of Flask extensions to see if async support has been added.
8. Other Event Loops
â€¢	Flask currently supports only asyncio.
â€¢	flask.Flask.ensure_sync() can be overridden to use a different async library.
