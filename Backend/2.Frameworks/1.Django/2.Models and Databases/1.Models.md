Models
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

The basics:
Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API; see Making queries.


Example: 

from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
   
first_name and last_name are fields of the model. Each field is specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a database column.
The above Person model would create a database table like this:
CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
    "id" bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
);
Some technical notes:
The name of the table, myapp_person, is automatically derived from some model metadata but can be overridden. See Table names for more details.
An id field is added automatically, but this behavior can be overridden. See Automatic primary key fields.

Using models:
To use your defined models in Django, you need to add the module containing your models.py to the INSTALLED_APPS setting in your settings file. For example, if your models are in myapp.models, update INSTALLED_APPS to include "myapp". After adding new apps to INSTALLED_APPS, run manage.py migrate to apply migrations, or use manage.py makemigrations to create new migrations first.

Fields
Essential Part of a Model: Fields define the structure of the database.
Naming Conflicts: Avoid field names that conflict with Django’s API (e.g., clean, save, delete).

Example Model

from django.db import models

class Musician(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    instrument = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Album(models.Model):
    artist = models.ForeignKey(Musician, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    release_date = models.DateField()
    num_stars = models.IntegerField()

Field Types
Fields are instances of Django’s field classes.
They define:
Column Type: Data type in the database.
HTML Widget: Default form field in templates.
Validation Requirements: Constraints used in forms.

Common Field Options
null: If True, stores empty values as NULL in the database.
blank: If True, the field is allowed to be blank in forms.
choices: Defines options for a field. Uses a list of tuples.
default: Default value for the field.
help_text: Extra help text displayed with the form widget.
primary_key: If True, this field is the primary key for the model.
unique: If True, this field must be unique throughout the table.

Special Notes
Automatic Primary Key: Django adds an auto-incrementing primary key by default.
Verbose Names: Optional first argument for field types to define a human-readable name.

Example Usage of Choices
python
class Person(models.Model):
    SHIRT_SIZES = {
        "S": "Small",
        "M": "Medium",
        "L": "Large",
    }
    name = models.CharField(max_length=60)
    shirt_size = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=SHIRT_SIZES)

# Usage
p = Person(name="Fred Flintstone", shirt_size="L")
p.save()
p.get_shirt_size_display()  # Outputs: 'Large'
