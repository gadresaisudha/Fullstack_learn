Making queries:
Once you’ve created your data models, Django automatically gives you a database-abstraction API that lets you create, retrieve, update and delete objects. This document explains how to use this API. Refer to the data model reference for full details of all the various model lookup options.

Throughout this guide (and in the reference), we’ll refer to the following models, which comprise a blog application:

from datetime import date

from django.db import models


class Blog(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    tagline = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    email = models.EmailField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


class Entry(models.Model):
    blog = models.ForeignKey(Blog, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    headline = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    body_text = models.TextField()
    pub_date = models.DateField()
    mod_date = models.DateField(default=date.today)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
    number_of_comments = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    number_of_pingbacks = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    rating = models.IntegerField(default=5)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.headline


Creating Objects
Instantiation and Save:

Instantiate a model using keyword arguments.

Call save() to insert the object into the database.

Example:

python
from blog.models import Blog
b = Blog(name="Beatles Blog", tagline="All the latest Beatles news.")
b.save()
Single-Step Creation:

Use create() method to create and save an object in one step.

Saving Changes to Objects
Modify the object and call save() to update the database.

python
b5.name = "New name"
b5.save()
ForeignKey and ManyToManyField
ForeignKey: Assign an appropriate object to the field and call save().

python
entry.blog = cheese_blog
entry.save()
ManyToManyField: Use add() method to add related records.

python
entry.authors.add(joe)
entry.authors.add(john, paul, george, ringo)
Retrieving Objects
QuerySet: Represents a collection of objects from the database, similar to a SQL SELECT statement.

Manager: Each model has a default manager called objects for constructing QuerySets.

python
all_entries = Entry.objects.all()
Managers are only accessible via model classes to separate table-level operations from record-level operations.

In Django, managers and querysets play crucial roles in database operations:

Managers
Definition: A manager is a class that provides query operations for Django models. It acts as the interface through which Django models interact with the database.

Default Manager: Every Django model automatically gets a default manager called objects if no managers are defined.

Custom Managers: You can define custom managers to add additional methods or alter the behavior of the default manager.

Example:

python
from django.db import models

class Blog(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    tagline = models.TextField()

    class BlogManager(models.Manager):
        def get_queryset(self):
            return super().get_queryset().filter(name__icontains='django')

    objects = BlogManager()  # Using custom manager
QuerySets
Definition: A QuerySet is a collection of database objects that can be filtered, ordered, and manipulated. Think of it as a "database query" in Django terms.

Usage: You obtain QuerySets through a model's manager. QuerySets allow you to read the data from the database and perform various operations like filtering, ordering, and aggregation.

Example:

python
# Retrieve all Blog objects
all_blogs = Blog.objects.all()

# Filter blogs with a specific keyword
django_blogs = Blog.objects.filter(name__icontains='django')
.all() Method
Purpose: The all() method returns a QuerySet containing all objects from the database for that model.

Usage: It’s typically used when you want to retrieve all records for a particular model.

Example:

python
# Get all entries from the Entry model
all_entries = Entry.objects.all()
Summary
Managers: Act as the gateway to your model's data and provide query operations. You can use the default manager objects or define custom managers for specialized query logic.

QuerySets: Represent collections of model instances from the database. QuerySets are created through a model's manager and can be filtered, sliced, and modified.

Understanding managers and querysets is essential for working efficiently with Django models and performing database operations seamlessly. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask

Retrieving Specific Objects with Filters
Refining QuerySets
filter(kwargs)**:

Returns a new QuerySet containing objects that match the given lookup parameters.

Example:

python
Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2006)
exclude(kwargs)**:

Returns a new QuerySet containing objects that do not match the given lookup parameters.

Example:

python
Entry.objects.exclude(pub_date__year=2006)
Chaining Filters
You can chain multiple filters together to refine QuerySets.

python
Entry.objects.filter(headline__startswith="What")
               .exclude(pub_date__gte=datetime.date.today())
               .filter(pub_date__gte=datetime.date(2005, 1, 30))
Unique QuerySets
Each refinement creates a new, separate QuerySet that can be used independently.

python
q1 = Entry.objects.filter(headline__startswith="What")
q2 = q1.exclude(pub_date__gte=datetime.date.today())
q3 = q1.filter(pub_date__gte=datetime.date.today())
Lazy Evaluation
QuerySets are lazy and do not hit the database until evaluated.

python
q = Entry.objects.filter(headline__startswith="What")
q = q.filter(pub_date__lte=datetime.date.today())
q = q.exclude(body_text__icontains="food")
print(q)  # Database query executed here
Retrieving a Single Object
Use get() when you know a single object matches the query.

python
one_entry = Entry.objects.get(pk=1)
Raises DoesNotExist if no match is found.

Raises MultipleObjectsReturned if more than one match is found.

Other QuerySet Methods
Common methods include all(), get(), filter(), and exclude().

See the QuerySet API Reference for a complete list.

Limiting QuerySets
Use slicing to limit the number of results.

python
first_five = Entry.objects.all()[:5]
sixth_to_tenth = Entry.objects.all()[5:10]
Negative indexing is not supported.

Slicing returns a new QuerySet, except when using the “step” parameter, which evaluates the query.

Retrieve a single object using an index.

python
first_entry = Entry.objects.order_by("headline")[0]

Field Lookups in Django
Field lookups allow you to specify conditions similar to an SQL WHERE clause. They are used as keyword arguments in the filter(), exclude(), and get() methods of QuerySets.

Basic Syntax
Format: field__lookuptype=value (double underscore between field and lookup type).

Example:

python
Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__lte="2006-01-01")
Translates to:

sql
SELECT * FROM blog_entry WHERE pub_date <= '2006-01-01';
Common Lookups
exact: Matches an exact value.

python
Entry.objects.get(headline__exact="Cat bites dog")
Equivalent to:

sql
SELECT ... WHERE headline = 'Cat bites dog';
iexact: Case-insensitive exact match.

python
Blog.objects.get(name__iexact="beatles blog")
contains: Case-sensitive containment test.

python
Entry.objects.get(headline__contains="Lennon")
Translates to:

sql
SELECT ... WHERE headline LIKE '%Lennon%';
Case-insensitive version: icontains.

startswith / endswith: Matches the beginning or end of a string.

Case-insensitive versions: istartswith and iendswith.

Special Case: ForeignKey
You can use the field name suffixed with _id for ForeignKey fields.

python
Entry.objects.filter(blog_id=4)
Error Handling
Passing an invalid keyword argument raises TypeError.

Additional Lookups
Django supports about two dozen lookup types. For more details, refer to the field lookup reference.
