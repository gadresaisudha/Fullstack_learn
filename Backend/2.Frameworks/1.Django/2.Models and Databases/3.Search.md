Summary of Search in Django
Use Cases
Standard Textual Queries:

Basic filtering of objects based on text fields.

Example:

python
Author.objects.filter(name__contains="Terry")
Improvement: Case-insensitive matching (icontains).

Advanced Database Comparison Functions:

Using PostgreSQL for complex queries.

Example with unaccented comparison:

python
Author.objects.filter(name__unaccent__icontains="Helen")
Trigram Similarity: Comparing sequences of letters for more flexible matching.

python
Author.objects.filter(name__unaccent__lower__trigram_similar="Hélène")
Document-Based Search:

Useful for large blocks of text.

Full text search involves ignoring stop words, stemming words, and weighting words based on criteria.

Examples of full-document search engines: Elastic, Solr.

PostgreSQL Support:

Built-in full-text search.

Example:

python
Entry.objects.filter(body_text__search="cheese")
Combining searches on multiple fields:

python
Entry.objects.annotate(search=SearchVector("blog__tagline", "body_text")).filter(search="cheese")
